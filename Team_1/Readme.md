## Team 1: Alicia, Elena, Emily, Monica, Romy

Broad themes for team 1: trends by demographics, digital transformation, skills - current skills - mismatch with skills demand currently - development of additional skills, education training

* What are the demographic factors that show a statistical relationship with unemployment amongst city residents? What positions show a higher rate of turnover?
* Are entry-level jobs truly entry-level (i.e. is there an incongruency with stated vs. expected skills)? 
* How many of the jobs available require additional education?
* Who works in skilled occupations, and which categories of people are least represented in these occupations? What trends do we see and how might we interpret these trends?
* What types of companies and occupations will have the greatest opportunity and need for skilled workers?
* What groups of people will benefit the most from work development programs and what types of education/skill training will have the most lasting impact for those groups?  Are the training programs currently available from the city addressing the skills training that will be in demand? How accessible are these education opportunities?
* Determine how skills are currently mismatched for employer requirements (Work with Team 2 on this data, especially if youâ€™re wanting to explore which skills will be in greater demand in the future - recommendations to upskill residents should target projected skills in demand)
  * Provide recommendations to retrain/upskill residents
* How is digital transformation changing the labour market conditions? 
  * How have the broad sectors in Rancho Cordova changed, with respect to technical innovations as well as Covid?
* How has the labour market in Rancho Cordova changed over the past 5-10 years?
