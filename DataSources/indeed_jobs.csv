Job Overview
You’ll be part of the Amazon grocery team that supports one of Amazon’s busiest services: online grocery orders. It’s similar to a shopper role, except that you’ll be working in a grocery warehouse, but it’s not like our other bigger buildings, it’s more like the size of a grocery store. Amazon Fresh offers customers everything from cereal to ice cream to fresh flowers, so you’ll be preparing orders for customers, working in different environments – including refrigerated and freezer spaces for part of your shift. It can be cold, but we’ll provide you with the right gear to stay warm!
