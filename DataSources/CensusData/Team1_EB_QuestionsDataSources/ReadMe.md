All Data contains only 3 years’ worth of data 

3 – Years: 2017 through 2019

Reason:  I believe it’s reasonable to look at the last 3 years before the pandemic, and not much further out since these years before the pandemic we would expect to be fairly steady in just getting a rough idea of numbers.  
Exception:

-	If we need to look for trends in specificity, we can go back and pull more years around a set of data/collection points.  This can remain an option
b) In most cases the numerical values are % of populations, this is just a simple and reasonable way to just look at the proportions of the populations represented or unrepresented and also good to see trends.  So just took % versus doing totals AND %.

Question 1 & corresponding CSV datasets:

1a) What are the demographic factors that show a statistical relationship with unemployment amongst city residents? 

### “EMPLOYMENTSTATUS”  (age 16 under/over for those employment/unemployed; and female representation)

-	Populations 16 years and over
In labor force
Civilian labor force
Employed
Unemployed
Armed Forces
Not in labor force

-	Unemployment rate
-	Females 16 years and over
In labor force
Civilian labor force
Employed

-	Parents who have children under 6
-	Parents who have children 6 – 17

### “OCCUPATIONINDUSTRY” (% of population for those 16 years and over)

This dataset could potentially answer Question 1b – What positions show a higher rate of turnover.

### “EDUCATIONLANGUGAGES_inlaborforce” & “EDUCATIONLANGUGAGES_notinlaborforce” 

Number of individuals in the labor force and not in the labor force by education level and the language they speak at home.

Question 2 & corresponding CSV datasets:

2a) Who works in skilled occupations, and which categories of people are least represented in these occupations? 

### “INDUSTRYEmploymentbyGender” & “OCCUPATIONEmploymentbyGender”

Employment % is dichotomized between Male & Female, at the level of Industry and Occupation
