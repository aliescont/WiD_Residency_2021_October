## Team 2: Krystal, Ulrike, Lucille, Grace, Ruchika

Broad themes for team 2: where will we see job growth / decline, skills required by popular occupations/industries, gig economy, automation, commuters

* What are the reasons for job displacement and unemployment?
* As the skill sets required for employment change across industries, what are the emerging needs for residents to obtain, maintain, or transition into available positions?
  * Are there segments within the current population that predominantly lack the qualifications that will be most needed? (related to socioeconomic / demographic characteristics)
  * Will the current skill sets of the residents of Rancho Cordova and surrounding area match to plans the city has for workforce growth in the city & surrounding areas (if information is available)?
* What changes have been evident within prominent city industries and employers? Communications with business leaders?
* What industries and jobs are expected to experience the highest growth? (What skills will be most in demand for jobs within the next 5 years?) - What are the fastest growing industries and occupations in the Sacramento area & Rancho Cordova? 
* What skills are needed for these increasingly in-demand jobs? 
* Which jobs/occupations will experience the greatest declines? (Which will be less in demand?)
* Whatâ€™s the proportion of occupations in Rancho Cordova held by its residents vs. those who commute in?
* Which cities have conducted a workforce transformation, and what can we learn from their experiences? (Relatedly: are there infrastructure needs that should be addressed to enable any success seen in other cities?)
* Do gig workers make up a significant portion of the workforce that has experienced changes in employment trends recently?
* How is automation in industries impacting job availability? (How many workers are in jobs vulnerable to automation?; Are workers already experiencing changes in employment due to automation?)
